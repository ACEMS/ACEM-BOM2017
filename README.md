# ACEMS-BOM2017
The ACEMS - BOM Collaborative Workshops was held on August 7th, 2017 at the Bureau of Meteorology's melbourne Office.   

Thank you to everyone for coming along and contributing to the conversation. It was a highly successful workshop and we explored a range of very interesting projects including: satellite remote sensing, dealing with non-normality, using data assimilation for data quality control and next generation high quality rainfall datasets.
