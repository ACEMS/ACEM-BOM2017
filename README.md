# ACEMS-BOM2017
The ACEMS - BOM Collaborative Workshops was held on August 7th, 2017 at the Bureau of Meteorology's Melbourne Office.   

Thank you to all participants for contributing your time, your intellect and ideas. It was a highly successful workshop and we explored a range of interesting potential projects including: satellite remote sensing, dealing with non-normality, using data assimilation for data quality control and next generation high quality rainfall datasets.
