# ACEMS-BOM2017
Welcome to the ACEM + the Bureau of Meteorology 2017 Collaborative Workshop!


## Workshop Aim
This workshop will be hosted in Melbourne on August 7th, 2017 and aims to explore collaborative research opportunities between researchers from ACEMS and the Bureau of Meteorology. 

In order to make the best of the workshop time, presentations will be at a minimum and we will aim to spend at least 50% of the day working on addressing the methodological challenges relevant to the research themes.

Please explore the [wiki](https://github.com/ACEMS/ACEM-BOM2017/wiki) and [issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ACEM-BOM2017/issues) links at the top of this repository.

## Research Themes
1. Spatial analysis of extremem values 
2. Blending of observational data 
3. Statistical downscaling of climate models
